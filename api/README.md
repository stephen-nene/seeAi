## Creating and Activating a Python Virtual Environment

- A virtual environment is an isolated Python environment that allows you to install packages without affecting your system-wide Python installation. To create and activate a virtual environment, follow these steps:

    1. Create a new virtual environment:

        ```sh
        python -m venv seeai
        ```          


        **Replace path/to/venv with the desired path to your virtual environment directory.**
    2. Activate the virtual environment:
        
        On Windows:
        ```sh
           seeai\Scripts\activate
        ```

        On macOS and Linux:


        ```sh
            source seeai/bin/activate
        ```
 - install pycodestyle now       
```sh
pip install pycodestyle
pip install --upgrade pip

```

## Checking Python Code Style using pycodestyle

- Now that your virtual environment is active, you can use pycodestyle to check the style of a Python file. For example, suppose you have a Python file named optparse.py. To check its style, run the following command:

```sh
pycodestyle --first optparse.py
```

- The --first option displays only the first occurrence of each error found in the file. This helps to focus on the most critical issues first.
## Displaying Source Code for Each Error

- You can also make pycodestyle show the source code for each error and even display the relevant text from PEP 8:


```sh
pycodestyle --show-source --show-pep8 testing/data/E40.py
```

- This command will show the source code for each error found in the file E40.py along with the corresponding PEP 8 text.
## Displaying Error Statistics

- If you want to see how often each error was found in a specific directory, you can use the --statistics option:

```sh
pycodestyle --statistics -qq Python-2.5/Lib
```


- The -qq option is used to suppress all output except the error statistics. This will give you an overview of the different types of errors found in the Python files within the Python-2.5/Lib directory.
## Conclusion

- Congratulations! You have successfully installed pycodestyle, activated a Python virtual environment, and used pycodestyle to check the style of Python files. By following the PEP 8 guidelines, you can write clean, readable, and consistent Python code, making it easier for others to understand and maintain your code.

- Remember to regularly check your code for style violations using pycodestyle to ensure that your code adheres to the best practices and conventions of Python programming. Happy coding!
