### "See Eye" - Image Understanding & Description Platform

[![SeeAI Screenshot](./Screenshot.png)](https://see-ai.vercel.app/)

**SeeAI** is a web-based application that allows users to upload or capture images, and receive an automatic description of the image. The app can also count objects in the image if requested and provides the option to input an additional prompt for more detailed analysis. Additionally, SeeAI can speak the output aloud for accessibility.

## Features
- Upload or take an image via the platform.
- Automated description of the image's content.
- Object counting for specific use cases.
- Optional prompts for enhanced image analysis.
- Text-to-speech functionality to narrate the output.
